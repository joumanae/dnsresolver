# DNS Resolver

This is an example of a DNS resolver written in Go.

The purpose of a DNS resolver is to figure out what address is associated with what IP address. 

GOAL: This project is a fun way to learn:

How to parse a binary network protocol like DNS

How DNS works under the hood (whatâ€™s happening behind the scenes when you make a DNS query?) 

Other goal: writing under 200 lines of code for this, compared to the original Python project by Julia Evans.
